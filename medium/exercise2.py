# Build a simple text analyzer. Problem: Write a function count_words(text) that:

# Accepts a paragraph of text
# Returns a dictionary where keys are words and values are how many times they appeared (case-insensitive)
# Example input: | text = "AI is the future. The future is now."

# Expected Output: {'ai': 1, 'is': 2, 'the': 2, 'future': 2, 'now.': 1}

#  I WILL DO IT IN THE FUTURE
